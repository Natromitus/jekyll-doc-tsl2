| static [PairAllChannels](StationaryAudioStreamer/PairAllChannels) { get; } | Creates an action that triggers a press pairing button event at a SAS3 and attempts to actually pair it with Hearing Instrument(s). |
| static [PairChannelA](StationaryAudioStreamer/PairChannelA) { get; } | Creates an action that triggers a press pairing via streamer channel A button event at a SAS3 and attempts to actually pair it with Hearing Instrument(s). |
| static [PairChannelB](StationaryAudioStreamer/PairChannelB) { get; } | Creates an action that triggers a press pairing via streamer channel B button event at a SAS3 and attempts to actually pair it with Hearing Instrument(s). |
| static [PairChannelC](StationaryAudioStreamer/PairChannelC) { get; } | Creates an action that triggers a press pairing via streamer channel C button event at a SAS3 and attempts to actually pair it with Hearing Instrument(s). |
| static [StartStreaming](StationaryAudioStreamer/StartStreaming) { get; } | Creates an action that starts audio streaming via a SAS. |
| static [Stereo](StationaryAudioStreamer/Stereo) { get; } | Creates an action that triggers a select stereo streaming button event at a SAS3 |
| static [StopStreaming](StationaryAudioStreamer/StopStreaming) { get; } | Creates an action that stops audio streaming via a SAS. |
| static [VolumeDown](StationaryAudioStreamer/VolumeDown) { get; } | Creates an action that triggers a press volume down button event at a SAS3 |
| static [VolumeUp](StationaryAudioStreamer/VolumeUp) { get; } | Creates an action that triggers a press volume up button event at a SAS3 |
| static [IsPairedOnChannelAWith](StationaryAudioStreamer/IsPairedOnChannelAWith)(…) | Creates an action which asserts that the hiContext is paired with a specific accessory type on channel A |
| static [IsPairedOnChannelBWith](StationaryAudioStreamer/IsPairedOnChannelBWith)(…) | Creates an action which asserts that the hiContext is paired with a specific accessory type on channel B |
| static [IsPairedOnChannelCWith](StationaryAudioStreamer/IsPairedOnChannelCWith)(…) | Creates an action which asserts that the hiContext is paired with a specific accessory type on channel C |
| static [PairOnChannelAndSetInputMode](StationaryAudioStreamer/PairOnChannelAndSetInputMode)(…) | Creates an action that will pair the hearing instrument with an accessory to streamer channel A, B and C (if applicable), if a AccessoryType is provided that cannot be paired via SAS channel, that parameter will be ignored. |
| static [TriggerPairOnChannel](StationaryAudioStreamer/TriggerPairOnChannel)(…) | Creates an action that attempts to pair the hearing instrument with an accessory to streamer channel A, B and C (if applicable), but does not perform a boot on the HI, as this might be initiated from another test action. |
