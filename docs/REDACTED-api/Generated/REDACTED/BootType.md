| static [DspStopped](Boot/DspStopped) { get; } | Creates an action that boots the channel into DspStopped mode |
| static [FinalProgrammingToNotInHostModeStableDevice](Boot/FinalProgrammingToNotInHostModeStableDevice) { get; } | Creates an action that performs final programming, then boots the channel into NotInHostMode (offline) mode and waits for the device to become stable |
| static [FlightModeStableDevice](Boot/FlightModeStableDevice) { get; } | Creates an action that boots the channel into Flight mode and waits for the device to become stable |
| static [IsOperatingSystemStarted](Boot/IsOperatingSystemStarted) { get; } | Creates an action that asserts that the boot was successful and the operating system is ready |
| static [IsSoundProcessingAppRunning](Boot/IsSoundProcessingAppRunning) { get; } | Creates an action that asserts that the boot was successful and the sound processing application is processing data |
